Data mining Data mining is the process of analyzing 
dense volumes of data to find patterns, discover trends, 
and gain insight into how that data can be used. Data 
miners can then use those findings to make decisions or 
predict an outcome. Data mining is an interconnected 
discipline, blending the fields of statistics, machine 
learning, and artificial intelligence.
